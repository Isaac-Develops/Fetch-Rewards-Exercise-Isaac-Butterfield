<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a exercise to create a Points Web Service that:
1. Adds transactions for a specific payer and date.
2. Spends points using the rules below and return a list of { "payer": <string>, "points": <integer> } for each call.
  Rule 1. Spend the oldest points first (oldest based on transaction timestamp, not the order they're received)
  Rule 2. None of the payer's points can go negative
3. Returns all payer point balances.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have both npm and Node.js installed. You can check if both are installed using the following commands:
  ```sh
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```
  
If they aren't installed, please follow the instructions on the [NPM Docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

### Installation

Installation is pretty simple:

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Isaac-Develops/Fetch-Rewards-Exercise-Isaac-Butterfield.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the Service
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```

## Background

Our users have points in their accounts. Users only see a single balance in their accounts. But for reporting purposes we actually track their
points per payer/partner. In our system, each transaction record contains: payer (string), points (integer), timestamp (date).
  
For earning points it is easy to assign a payer, we know which actions earned the points. And thus which partner should be paying for the points.
  
When a user spends points, they don't know or care which payer the points come from. But, our accounting team does care how the points are
spent. There are two rules for determining what points to "spend" first:
  ● We want the oldest points to be spent first (oldest based on transaction timestamp, not the order they’re received)
  ● We want no payer's points to go negative.
  
  
<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
  
There are three provided routes available:

  `/add`
  
  - Method: POST
  - Description: Adds a new transaction.
  
  `/spend`
  
  - Method: PATCH
  - Description: Spends points, starting with the oldest.
  
  `/balances`
  
  - Method: GET
  - Description: Gets all payer point balances.
  
For an example, suppose you call "/add" with the following sequence of calls:
  
  ```sh
  { "payer": "DANNON", "points": 1000, "timestamp": "2020-11-02T14:00:00Z" }
  { "payer": "UNILEVER", "points": 200, "timestamp": "2020-10-31T11:00:00Z" }
  { "payer": "DANNON", "points": -200, "timestamp": "2020-10-31T15:00:00Z" }
  { "payer": "MILLER COORS", "points": 10000, "timestamp": "2020-11-01T14:00:00Z" }
  { "payer": "DANNON", "points": 300, "timestamp": "2020-10-31T10:00:00Z" }
  ```
  
Then you call "/spend" with the following request:
  ```sh
  { "points": 5000 }
  ```
  
The expected response from the spend call would be:
  ```sh
  [
    { "payer": "DANNON", "points": -100 },
    { "payer": "UNILEVER", "points": -200 },
    { "payer": "MILLER COORS", "points": -4,700 }
  ]
  ```
  
A subsequent call to "/balances", after the spend, should return the following results:
  ```sh
  {
    "DANNON": 1000,
    "UNILEVER": 0,
    "MILLER COORS": 5300
  }
  ```
  
## Unit Tests
  
There are unit tests available in the test folder. To run these tests, run the test script using npm:
  ```sh
  npm run test
  ```
